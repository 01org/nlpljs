<!--
wraps a single element in a scrollable area;
when the wrapped element is shorter than the scrollable area, a button
is shown which triggers a "morecontent" event when pressed;
if the wrapped element is the same height or taller than the scroller,
the button is hidden and a vertical scrollbar is added; then, when the
end of the scroll is reached, a "more content" event is fired (the same
as if the button were pressed)

for this to work, the infini-scroll element should have a fixed size
(e.g. set width and height to a percentage of its parent element);
and the element you are wrapping must fire a "resize" event when its
dimensions change, with this data:

  {
    width: <new width in pixels>,
    height: <new height in pixels>
  }

note that if multiple elements are inside an infini-scroll, only the
first one is used to determine whether the button is visible and
to set the y scroll boundary

for the "no content" display to be toggled on/off, the wrapped
element should also fire a "childadded" event when new child elements
are added to it (NB it would be nice to use MutationObservers for
this, but these don't work inside the Shadow DOM, which is where
the child events we're interested in are being added)
